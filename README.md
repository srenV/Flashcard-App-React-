# Flashcard App (React)

A simple flashcard web app built with React and Vite. This project is one of my early React projects — I'm still learning, and the app needs further work and polish.


## Features

- View flashcards
- Switch between study mode and a full cards view
- Create and manage decks (work in progress)

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (>=16)

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (Vite default) in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — source files (components, sections, context)
- `public/data.json` — initial flashcard data

## Notes

- I'm still learning React — this is one of my first React projects.
- The project is not production-ready and requires additional testing, error handling, and features.
- Some code comments were initially generated with AI and may be imperfect; please feel free to improve or replace them.
